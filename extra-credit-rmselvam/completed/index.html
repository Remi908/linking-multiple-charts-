        This dashboard provides insights into total sales by product category
        and monthly sales trends for the selected category. Click on a bar to
        update the line chart below.

      <p style="text-align: center; font: size 10px;">
        This visualization shows total sales across different product
        categories, such as Furniture, Technology, and Office Supplies, using a
        bar chart. It also includes a line chart that displays the monthly sales
        trends for a selected category, using the "Sales" column over time. The
        "Category" column is used to group the total sales in the bar chart, and
        the "Order Date" column is used to calculate monthly trends for the line
        chart. When you click on a bar in the bar chart, the line chart updates
        to show how the sales for that category have changed over the months.
        This helps you understand both the overall and time-based performance of
        each category.
